# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# place = Place.create(name: "The Empty Bottle", address: "1074 N. Western")
# place = Place.create(name: "Concord Music Hall", address: "2800 N. Milwaukee")
# place = Place.create(name: "Metro", address: "3700 N. Clark")
# place = Place.create(name: "Rosa's Lounge", address: "3400 West Armitage")
